React is a library, not a framework.

An example tool: [react icons](https://github.com/gorangajic/react-icons)

1. Import the package using npm
2. Render with components

To install a new package:
- npm install --save react-icons

This adds the package to our dependencies so we can import them into our app.

import Terrain from 'react-icons'
